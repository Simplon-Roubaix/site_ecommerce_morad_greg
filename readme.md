# PHP project : Ecommerce site (2 people work)

## Presentation :  
We had to create an ecommerce site using PHP and a MySQL database.

## What's inside ?  
__include folder__ : contains all .php files  
- _admin_ part :  admin.php, admin_post.php, modif_vehicules.php. These 3 pages allow admin user to create,
modify or delete new products  
- _client_ part : accueil.php, manager.php, carte.php, details.php. These pages display all the created products.
cartes.php displays all products, details.php displays a more precise view of products  
- _user_ managing : sign.php, sign_manager.php

__connection to database__ : db folder with dbconnect.php are added in gitignore so they aren't displayed on repo


## How ?  
PHP + MySQL db
